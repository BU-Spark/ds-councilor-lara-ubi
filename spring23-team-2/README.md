Team 2

This project aims to provide recommendations for the selection process of a Universal Basic Income (UBI)  program for Boston. The analysis considers the number of people under the poverty line, levels of poverty, and public assistance programs to identify potential program participants. The goal is to lift people out of poverty through the implementation of an effective UBI program, and the project's output will provide recommendations to Boston City Councilor Kendra Lara for selecting program participants.
