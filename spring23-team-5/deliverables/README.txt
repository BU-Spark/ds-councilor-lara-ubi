The project focuses on Universal Basic Income (UBI) in Boston, Massachusetts. Our team, comprising Lamya, Yusra, Alex, Tsung-Han, and Xiaoyu, conducted two interconnected projects to analyze the economic condition of families and households in Boston. The first project aimed to determine the criteria for selecting participants for the universal basic income pilot program, while the second project explored the correlation between household income and family structure. The team analyzed data related to income distribution, participation in assistance programs, family size and poverty level, poverty level percentages, children and elderly in families, marital status of parents, and employment status.
